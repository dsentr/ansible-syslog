# ansible-syslog

This repository contains an Ansible playbook to setup syslog-ng with logrotate (config files based on an Ubuntu 18.04 LTS operating system).

Syslog-ng is a free and open-source service available for Linux systems.
Logrotate is a built in Linux utility to manage log files using rotation, compression, and removal.

Combining syslog-ng and logrotate can create a powerful solution for log management.
